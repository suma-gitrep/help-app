              <p >In 1983 Bonnie Williams, daughter of respected Maryville resident Inez Bowman, told her mother about 
                    an emergency response system that was available in Iowa City, IA.  She thought her mother
                    might be interested in the program.  Inez was intrigued by the concept and brought it to the 
                    Maryville Citizens for Community Action (MCCA) for consideration.  The MCCA Human Resources Task
                    Force thought it warranted further investigation and approached St. Francis Hospital to see if 
                    they would be interested in establishing the program.  The Hospital had already heard of the 
                    program and they were considering it.</p>
              <br>
              <P>A committee, consisting of Martin Goedken from St. Francis Hospital, Mildred Davis, Inez Bowman and
                  a Holt traveled to St. Joseph, MO to talk to the Lifeline volunteer coordinator to see how their 
                  organization operated.  After this meeting the St. Francis Hospital administration decided that 
                  the funds were not available to buy the units necessary to begin the program.  Undaunted, a group
                   of individuals decided to undertake the program.
                  </P>
              <p>Frank strong volunteered to help file the articles of incorporation that were signed by Inez Bowman
                 as vice president, Bob Bush as president and Donna Holt as treasurer.  On May 11, 1984, the
                 Health Emergency Lifeline Program (HELP) became a not-for-profit corporation.  A federal tax
                 number was issued to the new organization on October 18, 1984.  The all-volunteer organization 
                 known as, the Health Emergency Lifeline Program, Inc. was born.</p>
              <p>    
                 The first contract with Lifeline Systems, Inc., whose home office is in Massachusetts, was signed 
                 on June 29, 1984.  The units and new response center were shipped, and the first installation was
                 set up for Wednesday, August 22, 1984 at 11:00 a.m. for Florence Zimmerman.  It was quite a media 
                 event KQTV out of St. Joseph, MO and local media attending.
              </p>
              <p>
                  
                 Funding to start the program came from two large donations.  The St. Francis Hospital Auxiliary 
                 donated $5,000 and the Business and Professional Women (BPW) donated $5,000 that had come to them
                 from a bequest.  Officers of HELP decided to lease the equipment rather than purchase it outright.
                 This turns out to have been a wise decision.  HELP would not have been able to expand the program if the 
                 units and response center had to be purchased.  At the time, individual units cost $495 and the 
                 response center $7,000.
                 
              </p>
                 <p>     
                 Leasing has allowed HELP to stay current with the latest technology.  The life of each lease is 
                 five years.  When the time period for each lease is ended, HELP’s Executive Committee seeks approval
                 from its Board of Directors to enter a new lease for the same number, a lesser number or a greater
                 number of units.  That decision is driven by whether there are several names on the waiting list. 
                 With over 150 units in service in 2008, the program continues to be a valuable resource for Nodaway
                 county community members and those living in the surrounding area whose doctors utilize St. Francis  
                 Hospital and Health Services.  In the summer of 2004, the volunteers who operate the program were happy 
                 to celebrate 20 years of dedicated service and caring for their neighbors through the Health Emergency 
                 Lifeline Program.
              </p>
              <p>    
                 In 2011 a transition from site monitoring at St. Francis Hospital to central monitoring from a 
                 location in Massachusetts was successfully completed.  This change occurred because the site monitoring 
                 unit at St. Francis would become obsolete in 2012-- no longer able to be serviced.  Site monitoring
                 was free; central monitoring carries a monthly charge for each unit monitored. HELP has converted 
                 all program units from leased to owned property over the past 5 years with the return of the final 
                 leased units to Lifeline in February 2015.  The commitment to ownership allows HELP to keep costs 
                 as affordable as possible to our Nodaway County subscribers.  
              </p>
              <p>    
                 HELP current inventory has declined due to the discontinuance of the first digital units (DT 1000)
                 and rollovers, we currently have an inventory of 88 units which includes the addition of cellular 
                 based units. HELP still has some DT 1000s in use and are gradually replacing them as they fail to 
                 work.  Future purchases will include both landline (6900 Model Units) and cellular (7000 Series 
                 Units) communicators.  In addition, there are units now being used that are mobile and do not use 
                 a base communicator.  Communication is all through the button.
              </p>
              <p>      
                 Since 1984, HELP has served 1,155 subscribers as of 2019.  Of the current subscribers, 78 have had
                 Lifeline between one to ten years; 6 have had Lifeline over ten years of which 2 subscribers have 
                 received services for more than 15 years.  Remaining in the security and comfort of their own home 
                 has been a reality for these valued members of our community.

          <p class="page-section-heading text-secondary mb-0">*You can call Philips Lifeline or contact one of the local members to find
              how to become a
              subscriber. If you call Phillips Lifeline, the fee they quote might be slightly higher
              than
              what HELP charges. They will take your information and forward it to us. At the time of our
              follow-up call to you, we will quote you the local fee.
